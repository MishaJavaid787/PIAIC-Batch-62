I’m a very tech-savvy person.”\n\n**0:57-1:02** The woman’s hands are mostly still. “I love to update myself about all the technological advancement in the world and that’s why I…when I joined urban development sector, I felt that there is a need to incorporate all the emerging, you know, AI-related techniques.”\n\n**1:02-1:15** The woman uses hand gestures as she talks. “And information technology…related things to upgrade our, you know, sewage and water supply system.”\n\n**1:15-1:29** She continues explaining her work. “And I have always been interested in numbers and tech…I’m a very tech-savvy person.
