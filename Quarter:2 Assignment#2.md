## Understanding Key API and Software Concepts
# API  
Application processing interfaces acts as massagers that allow different applications to connect with each other to transfer data and functionalities without exposing the inner working of the system. APIs work through request-response sent between client and the server. Expmle; Weather Checking App, Online Payment App etc.
# SDK  
Software Development kit contains built-in components, libraries, as well as APIs and frameworks for software development on a specific platform. SDK assists developers to build cost efficient software and deploy across multiple platforms quickly.
# Web APIs 
Web APIs enable data transmission between web based systems through HTTP protocol. Developers use these APIs to extend the functionality of their applications and websites. Examples: Pinterest, Google Maps, Facebook API, etc.
# Library APIs 
Librray APIs are programming language specific APIs which are compiled into code as an additional library. Library APIs are locally installed and involves no web communication. 
Examples: JavaAPI, Python API, C++ API, etc.
# Prompting and Completion 
Prompting is the input phase which guides LLM model regarding user’s intent and produces appropriate responses. Completion is the output phase where model generates responses to fulfill user’s request. 
The clarity of prompt and training of model determine the quality of completion.
