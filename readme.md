# Python Programming Assignment:  
## Number Exploration Tool
### Instructions
**The purpose of the assignment is to create a Python program that serves as an interactive tool for a friend who enjoys exploring numbers.**
1. The program will begin by prompting the users to enter their name.
2. Users will then enter three of their favorite numbers. 
3. After gathering this information, the program will greet the users with a personalized message that includes their name.
   
**"The three numbers provided by the user will be stored in a _list_."** 

4. The program will then check if any of the numbers are **even** or **odd**, and store this information in a separate list of **tuples**, _where each tuple contains the number and a string indicating whether it is "even" or "odd" number._
5. Following this, the program will use a for loop to iterate over the list of numbers, and for each number will create a tuple containing the number and its square. 
*These tuples will be printed in a creative and engaging format.* 
- Additionally, the program will calculate the sum of the three numbers and print the result, accompanied by an encouraging message. 
- Finally, the program will determine if the sum is a prime number and notify the user with an appropriate message.
   
***The goal is to make the tool both enjoyable and informative, allowing the user to explore their favorite numbers in a fun and interactive way, while also introducing some interesting logical checks.***
